RELEASE NOTES:
- refreshing the page is currently not supported (please return to the original link above if you refresh and receive an error message)
- on each map, there is a stray element (a tiny, green box near the map name) whose source is TBD, but will be removed in future updates
- each map requires scrolling (right/down) to reach the molecules (due to the mapping coordinates, the molecules are not visible until you scroll after opening the map's page)

## Functionality
### Zoom-in on map areas to explore the structures of molecules in that part of the map:

### Click on a molecule (in either map) to see the molecule's name and top 3 scent descriptors:

*NOTE: sidebar will not be visible if zoomed in; zoom out again to see the sidebar for the molecule you selected*
